Their ages ranged from 65.3 to 79 years. The pooled effect estimate showed that HFNC decreased the incidence of hypoxia during the procedure when compared to LFNC (odds ratio 0.84; 95 confidence interval CI 1.65, 0.02; P  0.04), and the mean of lowest oxygen saturation in patients during sedation was significantly lower in LFNC compared to HFNC (mean difference 2.34; 95 CI 1.35, 3.32; P  0.001). The pooled effect estimate showed that the HFNC group had a lower incidence rate of jaw thrusting adverse events during anesthesia than the LFNC group (risk difference 0.12; 95 CI 0.21, 0.04; P  0.001)"

There was variation in pre-oxygenation strategies and primary outcomes. Available evidence suggests that high-flow nasal oxygen was not superior to facemask pre-oxygenation in achieving target end-tidal oxygen concentrations. High-flow nasal oxygen may increase the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, but the evidence of increased apnoea time was inconsistent. There were no reported adverse maternal effects or differences in neonatal Apgar scores, umbilical cord gases or fetal heart rate assessments."

Both preoperative physiotherapy (relative risk RR, 0.49, 95 confidence interval CI, 0.35-0.69, P  .01) and postoperative CPAP (RR, 0.53, 95 CI, 0.30-0.94, P  .029) reduced the incidence of PPCs. Intraoperative protective mechanical ventilation had unclear effects (RR, 0.90, 95 CI, 0.77-1.06, P  .22). No benefits were observed for HFNC (RR, 0.88, 95 CI, 0.70-1.11, P  .30) and physiotherapy regimens administered in the postoperative period only (RR, 0.89, 95 CI, 0.69-1.16, P  .40)."
item_7JLC2J4F,Perioperative oxygen therapy: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.,Adel Elfeky,2025 Jun 6,"RESULTS: Fifty-nine systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria, from which five anchoring reviews were selected. Perioperative high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2), 80), compared with a low Fio(2) (30-35), may reduce the incidence of SSI slightly (risk ratio RR 0.87, 95 confidence interval CI 0.76-1.01; risk difference RD 1.6 lower, 3 lower to 0.1 higher), but the evidence is very uncertain. High inspired oxygen may result in little to no difference in mortality (RR 1.17, 95 CI 0.77-1.78, RD 0.3 higher, 0.4 lower to 1.3 higher), based on low-certainty evidence. The evidence suggests that high Fio(2) results in a large increase in the incidence of atelectasis (RR 1.47, 95 CI 1.20-1.79, RD 6.5 higher, 2.8 higher to 10.9 higher, low-certainty evidence). Postoperative noninvasive ventilation (NIV) does not reduce mortality compared with conventional oxygen therapy (COT; RR 0.91, 95 CI 0.62-1.32, RD 0.1 lower, 0.6 lower to 0.5 higher), based on high-certainty evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggests that postoperative high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) compared with COT does not reduce mortality (RR 0.78, 95 CI 0.27-2.24, RD 0.4 lower, 1.4 lower to 2.4 higher)."

Critical Appraisals through Updated Meta-Analyses with Multiple Methodologies and Depiction of Certainty of Evidence.,Chi Chan Lee,2022 Jul 3,"Results: Eight RCTs were included. Compared to COT, HFNC did not reduce the overall incidence of hypoxemia (RR 0.51; 95 CI 0.24-1.09; CoE: very low) but might reduce the incidence of hypoxemia in patients at moderate to high risk for hypoxemia (RR 0.54; 95 CI 0.31-0.96; and CoE: very low). HFNC might reduce the incidence of severe hypoxemia (RR 0.38; 95 CI 0.20-0.74; and CoE: low). HFNC might not affect the need of minor airway interventions (RR 0.31; 95 CI 0.08-1.22; and CoE: very low) and had no effect on procedure duration (CoE: very low)"
