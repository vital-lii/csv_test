item_CWVI2NE5,A comparison of high-flow nasal cannula and standard facemask as pre-oxygenation technique for general anesthesia: A PRISMA-compliant systemic review and meta-analysis.,Hsien-Cheng Kuo,"BACKGROUND: Current practice guidelines recommend the use of nasal cannula as an alternative pre-oxygenation method for tracheal intubation. However, the efficacy of high-flow nasal oxygenation versus standard facemask oxygenation has not been fully evaluated. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov for English-language studies published from January 1, 2000 to November 30, 2021. We included randomized controlled trials which compared high-flow nasal oxygenation and facemask oxygenation as the pre-oxygenation maneuver. Primary outcome was arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2) after pre-oxygenation. Secondary outcomes were safe apnea time, arterial desaturation during intubation, lowest peripheral capillary oxygen saturation during intubation, and patient comfort score. Random-effects models and Mantel-Haenszel method were used for data synthesis. RESULTS: A total of 16 randomized controlled trials and 1148 patients were included. High-flow nasal oxygenation achieved a higher PaO2 compared with facemask, mean difference: 64.86 mm Hg (95 confidence interval CI: 32.33-97.40, P  .0001). Safe apnea time was longer in high-flow nasal oxygenation, mean difference: 131.03 seconds (95 CI: 59.39-202.66, P  .0001). There was no difference in the risk of peri-intubation desaturation or lowest peripheral capillary oxygen saturation between groups. Patient comfort score was higher in high-flow nasal oxygenation, mean difference: 1.00 (95 CI: 0.46-1.54, P  .0003). CONCLUSION: High-flow nasal oxygenation better enhanced PaO2 and extended safe apnea time and is not inferior to facemask oxygenation in preventing desaturation during tracheal intubation. High-flow nasal oxygenation may be considered as an alternative method, especially for patients with a potential difficult airway.",2022 Mar 11,"RESULTS: A total of 16 randomized controlled trials and 1148 patients were included.

item_Z66CTS68,Comparing oxygen therapies for hypoxemia prevention during gastrointestinal endoscopy under procedural sedation: A systematic review and network meta-analysis.,Shuailei Wang,"STUDY OBJECTIVE: Hypoxemia is the most frequent adverse event observed during gastrointestinal endoscopy under procedural sedation. An optimum oxygen therapy has still not been conclusively determined. DESIGN: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials. SETTING: Digestive Endoscopy Center. PATIENTS: Adults (18 years old and of both sexes) during gastrointestinal endoscopy under procedural sedation. INTERVENTIONS: Pubmed, MEDLINE, Web of Science, Embase, and Clinicaltrials.gov. were searched until June 30, 2023. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing any oxygen therapy with another oxygen therapy or with placebo (nasal cannula, NC) were included. MEASUREMENT: The primary outcome was the incidence of hypoxemia, defined as the pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2)). Random-effects network meta-analyses were performed. Data are reported as odds ratios (OR), prediction intervals (PrI) and 95 CI. Bias risk was evaluated following the guidelines outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration. The quality of evidence was evaluated through the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) framework. MAIN RESULTS: We included 27 RCTs with a total of 7552 patients. Compared to the use of NC, non-invasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) demonstrated superior efficacy in mitigating hypoxemia (NIPPV vs. NC, OR  0.16, 95 CI: 0.08-0.31, 95 PrI: 0.06-0.41), followed by Wei nasal jet tube (WNJT) (WNJT vs. NC, OR  0.17, 95 CI: 0.10-0.30, 95 PrI: 0.07-0.42). The efficacy for preventing hypoxemia was ranked as follows: NIPPV  WNJT  oropharynxnasopharyngeal catheter  high-flow nasal oxygenation  nasal mask  NC. CONCLUSIONS: During gastrointestinal endoscopy under procedural sedation, all other advanced oxygen therapies were found to be more efficacious than nasal cannula. NIPPV and WNJT appear to be the most efficacious oxygen therapy for preventing hypoxemia. Additionally, clinicians should make a choice regarding the most suitable oxygen therapy based on the risk population, type of endoscopy and adverse events.",2024 Nov,"RESULTS: We included 27 RCTs with a total of 7552 patients.

The present meta-analysis was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Two authors independently searched three electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library to identify relevant articles published in English from inception to February 2023. Searching was conducted using keywords and medical subject headings (MeSH), which included ""conventional oxygen therapy,"" ""high-flow nasal cannula,"" ""extubation,"" ""pediatrics,"" and ""cardiac surgery."" Our primary outcome was extubation failure defined as the need for reintubation within 24 to 72 hours after planned extubation. Secondary outcomes assessed in this meta-analysis included partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), and the ratio of PaO2 and FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen). A total of three studies were included in the meta-analysis, with a total of 227 patients. No significant difference was found between the two groups (the HFNC group and the COT group) in terms of reintubation (RR: 0.88, 95 CI: 0.34, 2.30, p-value: 0.80). Pooled meta-analysis showed that PaO2 was significantly greater in patients receiving HFNC at six hours (MD: 33.73, 95 CI: 18.33, 49.14, p-value0.001), at 12 hours (MD: 44.90, 95 CI: 28.59, 61.22, p-value0.001) and at 24 hours (MD: 43.53, 95 CI: 29.16, 57.91, p-value0.001) of extubation.

item_BUT6USF9,Comparison of the effectiveness of high-flow nasal oxygen vs. standard facemask oxygenation for pre- and apneic oxygenation during anesthesia induction: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,Jian-Li Song,"BACKGROUND: In recent years, high flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) has been widely used in clinic, especially in perioperative period. Many studies have discussed the role of HFNO in pre- and apneic oxygenation, but their results are controversial. Our study aimed to examine the effectiveness of HFNO in pre- and apneic oxygenation by a meta-analysis of RCTs. METHODS: EMBASE, PUBMED, and COCHRANE LIBRARY databases were searched from inception to July 2021 for relevant randomized controlled trails (RCTs) on the effectiveness of HFNO versus standard facemask ventilation (FMV) in pre- and apenic oxygenation. Studies involving one of the following six indicators: (1) Arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO(2)), (2) End expiratory oxygen concentration (EtO(2)), (3) Safe apnoea time, (4) Minimum pulse oxygen saturation (SpO(2min)), (5) Oxygenation (O(2)) desaturation, (6) End expiratory carbon dioxide (EtCO(2)) or Arterial carbon dioxide partial pressure(PaCO(2)) were included. Due to the source of clinical heterogeneity in the observed indicators in this study, we adopt random-effects model for analysis, and express it as the mean difference (MD) or risk ratio (RR) with a confidence interval of 95 (95CI). We conducted a risk assessment of bias for eligible studies and assessed the overall quality of evidence for each outcome. RESULTS: Fourteen RCTs and 1012 participants were finally included. We found the PaO(2) was higher in HFNO group than FMV group with a MD (95 CI) of 57.38 mmHg (25.65 to 89.10; p  0.0004) after preoxygenation and the safe apnoea time was significantly longer with a MD (95 CI) of 86.93 s (44.35 to 129.51; p  0.0001) during anesthesia induction. There were no significant statistical difference in the minimum SpO(2), CO(2) accumulation, EtO(2) and O(2) desaturation rate during anesthesia induction between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that HFNO should be considered as an oxygenation tool for patients during anesthesia induction.

METHODS: We searched six databases for randomised controlled trials of patients aged 16 yr, receiving general anaesthesia in any setting and comparing different preoxygenation techniques and methods. Our primary effectiveness outcome was safe apnoea time, and secondary outcomes included incidence of arterial oxygen desaturation; lowest SpO(2) during airway management; time to end-tidal oxygen concentration of 90; and Formula: see text and Formula: see text at the end of preoxygenation. We assessed the quality of evidence according to Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) recommendations. RESULTS: We included 52 studies of 3914 patients. High-flow nasal oxygen with patients in a head-up position was most likely to be associated with a prolonged safe apnoea time when compared with other strategies, with a mean difference (95 credible interval) of 291 (138-456) s and 203 (79-343) s compared with preoxygenation with a facemask in the supine and head-up positions, respectively. Subgroup analysis of studies without apnoeic oxygenation also showed high-flow nasal oxygen in the head-up position as the highest ranked technique, with a statistically significantly delayed mean difference (95 credible interval) safe apnoea time compared with facemask in supine and head-up positions of 222 (63-378) s and 139 (15-262) s, respectively. High-flow nasal oxygen was also the highest ranked technique for increased Formula: see text at the end of preoxygenation. However, the incidence of arterial desaturation was less likely to occur when a facemask with pressure support was used compared with other techniques, and Formula: see text was most likely to be lowest when preoxygenation took place with patients deep breathing in a supine position. CONCLUSIONS: Preoxygenation of adults before induction of general anaesthesia was most effective in terms of safe apnoea time when performed with high-flow nasal oxygen with patients in the head-up position in comparison with facemask alone. Also, high-flow nasal oxygen in the head-up position is likely to be the most effective technique to prolong safe apnoea time among those evaluated. Clinicians should consider this technique and patient position in routine practice. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW PROTOCOL: PROSPERO CRD42022326046.",2024 Jul,"RESULTS: We included 52 studies of 3914 patients.

Non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) alternative to conventional oxygen therapy (COT), i.e., high-flow nasal oxygen, continuous positive airway pressure, and non-invasive ventilation (NIV), has been proposed to prevent or treat post-extubation respiratory failure. Aim of the present study is assessing the effects of NRS application, compared to COT, on the re-intubation rate (primary outcome), and time to re-intubation, incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, patient discomfort, intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital length of stay, and mortality (secondary outcomes) in adult patients extubated after surgery. METHODS: A systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomized and non-randomized controlled trials. A search from Medline, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Web of Science from inception until February 2, 2024 was performed. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies (11,292 patients) were included. Among all NRS modalities, only NIV reduced the re-intubation rate, compared to COT (odds ratio 0.49, 95 confidence interval 0.28; 0.87, p  0.015, I(2)  60.5, low certainty of evidence). In particular, this effect was observed in patients receiving NIV for treatment, while not for prevention, of post-extubation respiratory failure, and in patients at high, while not low, risk of post-extubation respiratory failure. NIV reduced the rate of nosocomial pneumonia, ICU length of stay, and ICU, hospital, and long-term mortality, while not worsening patient discomfort.

METHODS: This study protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022309391). Adult studies that compared HFNC and FM preoxygenation in obese patients requiring general anesthesia for elective surgery were included. The primary outcome was desaturation resulting in oxygen saturation of 92 from induction of anesthesia until intubation. Secondary outcomes included the lowest arterial oxygen content before intubation expressed in mm Hg, safe apnea time expressed in seconds, the lowest oxygen saturation before intubation expressed as a percentage, patient-reported discomfort, the need for rescue ventilation, and the incidence of aspiration of gastric contents during intubation.

Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature search across PubMed-MEDLINE, EMBASE-OVID, Scopus, and Web of Science databases up to July 20, 2024. Randomized controlled trials comparing HFNC with FM during RSII for emergency surgery patients were included. The primary outcomes were post-intubation arterial partial pressures of oxygen (PaO2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO2). Secondary outcomes included post-intubation end-tidal carbon dioxide concentration (EtCO2), incidence of desaturation, apnea time, lowest peripheral oxygen saturation (Lowest SpO2), and occurrence of regurgitant aspiration. We used the GRADE approach to assess the certainty of evidence and the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool to evaluate risk of bias. Findings This meta-analysis encompassed six studies, involving a total of 703 patients. HFNC oxygen therapy demonstrated a significant increase in post-intubation arterial PaO2 compared to FM (mean difference  63.02 mmHg, 95 CI: 8.99 to 117.05, p  0.02), while no significant difference was observed in arterial PaCO2. Moreover, HFNC substantially prolonged apnea time (mean difference  19.25 seconds, 95 CI: 1.69 to 36.82, p  0.03). No statistically significant differences were found between HFNC and FM regarding EtCO2, incidence of desaturation, Lowest SpO2, or regurgitant aspiration. Conclusion This systematic review and meta-analysis indicates that HFNC may be superior to FM for pre-oxygenation and apneic oxygenation during RSII in emergency surgeries, particularly in improving oxygenation. While these findings are promising, further high-quality research is necessary to establish definitive guidelines for HFNC use in this context.",2025/1/24,"six studies, involving a total of 703 patients.

High-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) may prevent hypoxemic events during bronchoscopy. We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to evaluate the effectiveness of HFNC in these patients. METHODS: We conducted a search in PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for RCTs published before November 2021. Individual effect sizes were standardized, and a meta-analysis was performed to calculate the pooled effect size using random-effects models. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypoxemic events (oxygen saturation SpO2  90) during bronchoscopy. Secondary outcomes included the incidence of interrupted bronchoscopy due to desaturation, lowest SpO2 during bronchoscopy, partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2), partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2), end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2) at the end of bronchoscopy, and the incidence of intubation after the procedure. RESULTS: Five trials involving 257 patients were reviewed. The incidence of hypoxemic events was lower in the HFNC group than in the conventional oxygen therapy group (risk ratio, 0.25; 95 confidence interval CI, 0.14-0.42). The lowest SpO2 during the procedure was significantly higher in the HFNC group than in the conventional oxygen therapy group (weighted mean difference WMD, 7.12; 95 CI, 5.39-8.84).

However, the data on its safety and efficacy is sparse. This study aims to aggregate the current data and compares the use of HFNC with tracheal intubation and jet ventilation in adult patients undergoing laryngeal surgery. We searched PubMed, MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online, or MEDLARS Online), Embase (Excerpta Medica Database), Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science. Both observational studies and prospective comparative studies were included. Risk of bias was appraised with the Cochrane Collaboration Risk of Bias in Non-Randomized Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) or RoB2 tools and the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) Critical Appraisal Checklist for case series. Data were extracted and tabulated as a systematic review. Summary statistics were performed. Meta-analyses and trial sequential analyses of the comparative studies were performed. Forty-three studies (14 HFNC, 22 JV, and seven comparative studies) with 8064 patients were included. In the meta-analysis of comparative studies, the duration of surgery was significantly reduced in the THRIVE (Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange) group, but the number of desaturations, need for rescue intervention, and peak end-tidal CO2 were significantly increased compared to the conventional ventilation group. The evidence was of moderate certainty and there was no evidence of publication bias. In conclusion, HFNC may be as effective as tracheal intubation in oxygenation during laryngeal surgery in selected adult patients and reduces the duration of surgery but conventional ventilation with tracheal intubation may be safer. The safety of JV was comparable to HFNC.",2023/5/5,NA

METHODS: English language literature searches of PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library electronic databases were performed to identify randomised controlled trials comparing HFNO and conventional oxygen therapy (COT) for patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy under deep sedation. The primary endpoint was the incidence of hypoxic events observed during endoscopic procedures. The secondary endpoints were the incidence of recourse to rescue manoeuvres, procedure interruption, and adverse events. A meta-analysis and a post hoc trial sequence analysis were performed. RESULTS: A total of 2867 patients from six randomised controlled trials were considered. Desaturation was observed in 5.2 and 27.2 of patients receiving HFNO and COT, respectively. Desaturation 90 was observed in 1.8 and 12.6 of the patients receiving HFNO and COT, respectively.

This systematic review aimed to evaluate the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in obstetric patients during the peri-operative period, focusing on maternal oxygenation and clinical outcomes. METHODS: We included studies published in any language, conducted in all countries. Search terms included terminology concerning obstetric anaesthesia related to the use of high-flow nasal oxygen in the peri-operative period. Included papers were assessed for risk of bias. Studies were included for detailed review if they evaluated the use of high-flow nasal oxygen as a pre-oxygenation strategy in obstetric patients and reported maternal or neonatal outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 649 abstracts were screened with 11 articles included. There was variation in pre-oxygenation strategies and primary outcomes. Available evidence suggests that high-flow nasal oxygen was not superior to facemask pre-oxygenation in achieving target end-tidal oxygen concentrations. High-flow nasal oxygen may increase the partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood, but the evidence of increased apnoea time was inconsistent. There were no reported adverse maternal effects or differences in neonatal Apgar scores, umbilical cord gases or fetal heart rate assessments. DISCUSSION: The advantages of peri-operative high-flow nasal oxygen over conventional oxygenation methods for obstetric patients remain uncertain.

The principal purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the perioperative lung protection strategies in patients undergoing elective noncardiothoracic surgery, informing clinicians on evidence-based perioperative care pathways. We also conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in noncardiothoracic surgery focusing on the following aspects: preoperative physiotherapy, intraoperative protective mechanical ventilation, postoperative prophylactic continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) or high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC), and postoperative physiotherapy. Both preoperative physiotherapy (relative risk RR, 0.49, 95 confidence interval CI, 0.35-0.69, P  .01) and postoperative CPAP (RR, 0.53, 95 CI, 0.30-0.94, P  .029) reduced the incidence of PPCs. Intraoperative protective mechanical ventilation had unclear effects (RR, 0.90, 95 CI, 0.77-1.06, P  .22). No benefits were observed for HFNC (RR, 0.88, 95 CI, 0.70-1.11, P  .30) and physiotherapy regimens administered in the postoperative period only (RR, 0.89, 95 CI, 0.69-1.16, P  .40). Lung-protective strategies should be considered throughout the entire perioperative period. The prophylactic use of strategies initiated in the postoperative period only, such as physiotherapy, CPAP, or HFNC, offers limited benefits.

item_7JLC2J4F,Perioperative oxygen therapy: an overview of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.,Adel Elfeky,"BACKGROUND: Perioperative oxygen is routinely used, but evidence of its clinical impact remains inconsistent, leading to variable practice. The aim of this work was to provide a comprehensive overview of the effectiveness of perioperative oxygen therapy strategies. METHODS: We searched multiple databases for systematic reviews comparing perioperative oxygen strategies. Two reviewers independently extracted data. The co-primary outcomes were surgical site infection (SSI) and mortality. We classified systematic reviews with the largest number of trials as anchoring reviews. We updated anchoring reviews with data from more recent RCTs. We assessed the risk of bias of the anchoring reviews using the ROBIS tool, updated meta-analyses and subgroup analyses, and undertook exploratory meta-regression. We assessed the certainty in evidence using GRADE framework and conducted trial sequential analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-nine systematic reviews met the inclusion criteria, from which five anchoring reviews were selected. Perioperative high fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio(2), 80), compared with a low Fio(2) (30-35), may reduce the incidence of SSI slightly (risk ratio RR 0.87, 95 confidence interval CI 0.76-1.01; risk difference RD 1.6 lower, 3 lower to 0.1 higher), but the evidence is very uncertain. High inspired oxygen may result in little to no difference in mortality (RR 1.17, 95 CI 0.77-1.78, RD 0.3 higher, 0.4 lower to 1.3 higher), based on low-certainty evidence. The evidence suggests that high Fio(2) results in a large increase in the incidence of atelectasis (RR 1.47, 95 CI 1.20-1.79, RD 6.5 higher, 2.8 higher to 10.9 higher, low-certainty evidence). Postoperative noninvasive ventilation (NIV) does not reduce mortality compared with conventional oxygen therapy (COT; RR 0.91, 95 CI 0.62-1.32, RD 0.1 lower, 0.6 lower to 0.5 higher), based on high-certainty evidence. Low-certainty evidence suggests that postoperative high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) compared with COT does not reduce mortality (RR 0.78, 95 CI 0.27-2.24, RD 0.4 lower, 1.4 lower to 2.4 higher). Low- to very low-certainty evidence indicates that postoperative NIV and HFNO may reduce some of the pulmonary adverse events compared with COT. Trial sequential analyses showed that further studies are required to determine which perioperative oxygen strategy is most clinically and cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: We did not find evidence to support routine use of high inspired oxygen to reduce surgical site infection and improve patient outcomes. A small reduction in surgical site infection associated with high Fio(2) cannot be ruled out and possible effect modifiers require further investigation. Existing evidence favours postoperative noninvasive ventilation and high-flow nasal oxygen over conventional oxygen therapy, but the low to very low certainty of evidence limits our confidence in the findings.

item_TFNKBJWH,Routine postoperative noninvasive respiratory support and pneumonia after elective surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials.,Sara Hui,"BACKGROUND: Postoperative pulmonary complications, including pneumonia, are a substantial cause of morbidity. We hypothesised that routine noninvasive respiratory support was associated with a lower incidence of pneumonia after surgery. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs comparing the routine use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), noninvasive ventilation (NIV), or high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) against standard postoperative care in the adult population. We searched MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE, and CENTRAL from the start of indexing to July 27, 2021. Articles were reviewed and data extracted in duplicate, with discrepancies resolved by a senior investigator. The primary outcome was pneumonia, and the secondary outcome was postoperative pulmonary complications. We calculated risk difference (RD) with 95 confidence intervals using DerSimonian and Laird random effects models. We assessed risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: From 18 513 records, we included 38 trials consisting of 9782 patients. Pneumonia occurred in 2144403 (4.9) patients receiving noninvasive respiratory support compared with 2163937 (5.5) receiving standard care (RD -0.01 95 confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.00; I(2)8; P0.23). Postoperative pulmonary complications occurred in 3931379 (28) patients receiving noninvasive respiratory support compared with 280902 (31) receiving standard care (RD -0.11 -0.23 to 0.01; I(2)79; P0.07). Subgroup analyses did not identify a benefit of CPAP, NIV, or HFNO in preventing pneumonia. Tests for publication bias suggest six unreported trials.

item_RDC6BYMM,The comparison of preoxygenation methods before endotracheal intubation: a network meta-analysis of randomized trials,Ming Zhong,"Background Preoxygenation before endotracheal intubation (ETI) maintains asphyxiated oxygenation and reduces the risk of hypoxia-induced adverse events. Previous studies have compared various preoxygenation methods. However, network meta-analyses (NMAs) of the combined comparison of preoxygenation methods is still lacking. Methods We searched for studies published in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library. Review Manager version 5.3 was used to evaluate the risk of bias. The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was low oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) during ETI. The secondary outcomes included SpO 2 80, SpO 2 90, and apnea time during ETI. NMA was performed using R 4.1.2 software gemtc packages in RStudio. Results A total of 15 randomized controlled trials were included in this study. Regarding the lowest SpO 2 , the noninvasive ventilation (NIV) with high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) group performed better than the other groups. For SpO 2 80, the NIV group (0.8603467) performed better than the HFNC (0.1373533) and conventional oxygen therapy (COT, 0.0023) groups, according to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve results. For SpO 2 90, the NIV group (0.60932667) performed better than the HFNC (0.37888667) and COT (0.01178667) groups. With regard to apnea time, the HFNC group was superior to the COT group (mean difference: 50.05; 95 confidence interval: 90.01, 10.09; P  0.01). Conclusion Network analysis revealed that NIV for preoxygenation achieved higher SpO 2 levels than HFNC and COT and offered a more significant advantage in maintaining patient oxygenation during ETI. Patients experienced a longer apnea time after HFNC preoxygenation. The combination of NIV with HFNC proved to be significantly superior to other methods. Given the scarcity of such studies, further research is needed to evaluate its effectiveness.

item_826AGVUK,The effect of high perioperative inspiratory oxygen fraction for abdominal surgery on surgical site infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis,Jae Hee Kuh,"Guidelines from the World Health Organization strongly recommend the use of a high fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) in adult patients undergoing general anesthesia to reduce surgical site infection (SSI). However, previous meta-analyses reported inconsistent results. We aimed to address this controversy by focusing specifically on abdominal surgery with relatively high risk of SSI. Medline, EMBASE, and Cochrane CENTRAL databases were searched. Randomized trials of abdominal surgery comparing high to low perioperative FiO2 were included, given that the incidence of SSI was reported as an outcome. Meta-analyses of risk ratios (RR) were performed using a fixed effects model. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were employed to explore sources of heterogeneity. We included 27 trials involving 15977 patients. The use of high FiO2 significantly reduced the incidence of SSI (n  27, risk ratio (RR): 0.87; 95 confidence interval (CI): 0.79, 0.95; I2  49, Z  3.05).

Only randomized clinical trials comparing HFNC with standard nasal cannula oxygen (SNC) during sedated digestive endoscopy were included. The incidence of hypoxemia was the primary outcome, and the secondary outcome was the percentage of patients who needed airway interventions. RESULTS: Seven studies that enrolled 2998 patients were included. When compared to SNC, HFNC was associated with a significant reduction in hypoxemia incidence (OR 0.24, 95 CI 0.09 to 0.64) and airway intervention requirements (OR 0.15, 95 CI 0.03 to 0.69), with both high heterogeneity (I(2)  81 and 94).

Spence,"BACKGROUND: High-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is increasingly being used in intensive care units for management of hypoxemia and respiratory failure. However, the effectiveness of HFNO for preventing hypoxemia in the intraoperative period is unclear. The purpose of this systematic review was to compare patient oxygenation and end-tidal CO2 (EtCO2), between HFNO and conventional oxygenation, during the intraoperative period in surgical patients. METHODS: Standard databases were searched from inception to February 2020. Studies involving intraoperative use of HFNO with 1 of the 4 outcomes: (1) oxygen (O2) desaturation, (2) minimum O2 saturation, (3) safe apnea time, or (4) EtCO2 were included. Intraoperative period was divided into 2 phases: at induction with general anesthesia and during surgical procedure under sedation without tracheal intubation. RESULTS: Eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs; 4 induction, 4 procedure, 2314 patients) were included for systematic review and meta-analyses. We found the risk of intraoperative O2 desaturation was lower in HFNO versus conventional oxygenation control group; at induction with an odds ratio (OR; 95 confidence interval CI) of 0.06 (0.01-0.59, P  .02), and during procedure, OR (95 CI) of 0.09 (0.05-0.18; P  .001). The minimum O2 saturation was higher in HFNO versus conventional oxygenation; at induction by a mean difference (MD) (95 CI) of 5.1 (3.3-6.9; P  .001), and during procedure, by a MD (95 CI) of 4.0 (1.8-6.2; P  .001).

EtCO2 at induction was not significantly different between HFNO and conventional oxygenation groups. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis show that, in the intraoperative setting, HFNO compared to conventional oxygenation reduces the risk of O2 desaturation, increases minimum O2 saturation, and safe apnea time.

DESIGN: A systematic search was conducted on MEDLINE and other databases from 1946 to December 16th, 2021. Title and abstract screening were conducted independently, and the lead investigators resolved conflicts. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model and are presented as mean difference and standardized mean difference with 95 confidence intervals. These were calculated using RevMan 5.4. PATIENTS: 1395 and 228 OSA patients underwent oxygen therapy and HFNC therapy respectively. INTERVENTIONS: Oxygen therapy and HFNC therapy. MEASUREMENTS: Apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO(2)), cumulative time with SPO(2)  90 (CT90). MAIN RESULTS: Twenty-seven oxygen therapy studies were included in the review, with ten randomized controlled trials (RCT), seven randomized crossovers, seven non-randomized crossovers, and three prospective cohorts. Pooled analyses showed that oxygen therapy significantly reduced AHI by 31 and increased SpO(2) by 5 versus baseline, and CPAP significantly reduced AHI by 84, and increased SpO(2) by 3 versus baseline. CPAP was 53 more effective in reducing AHI than oxygen therapy, but both treatments had similar effectiveness in increasing SpO(2). Nine HFNC studies were included in the review, with five prospective cohorts, three randomized crossovers, and one RCT. Pooled analyses showed that HFNC therapy significantly reduced AHI by 36 but did not substantially increase SpO(2). CONCLUSIONS: Oxygen therapy effectively reduces AHI and increases SpO(2) in patients with OSA. CPAP is more effective in reducing AHI than oxygen therapy. HFNC therapy is effective in reducing AHI. Although both oxygen therapy and HFNC therapy effectively reduce AHI, more research is needed to draw conclusions on clinical outcomes.",2023 Sep,"RESULTS: Twenty-seven oxygen therapy studies were included in the review, with ten randomized controlled trials (RCT), seven randomized crossovers, seven non-randomized crossovers, and three prospective cohorts.

item_3VLRCGB8,Use of high-flow nasal cannula versus other noninvasive ventilation techniques or conventional oxygen therapy for respiratory support following pediatric cardiac surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis,Islam Elmitwalli,"Introduction Noninvasive respiratory support may be provided to decrease the risk of postextubation failure following surgery. Despite these efforts, approximately 3?7 of infants and children still experience respiratory failure after tracheal extubation following cardiac surgery. This systematic review evaluates studies comparing the efficacy of high-flow nasal cannula to conventional oxygen therapy such as nasal cannula and other noninvasive ventilation techniques in preventing postextubation failure in this patient population. Methods A systematic and comprehensive search was conducted in major databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Central. The search encompassed articles focusing on the prophylactic use of high-flow nasal cannula following tracheal extubation in pediatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery for congenital heart disease. The inclusion criteria for this review consisted of randomized clinical trials as well as observational, cohort, and casecontrol studies. Results A total of 1295 studies were screened and 12 studies met the inclusion criteria. These 12 studies included a total of 1565 children, classified into three groups: seven studies compared high-flow nasal cannula to noninvasive ventilation techniques, four studies compared high-flow nasal cannula to conventional oxygen therapy, and one observational single-arm study explored the use of high-flow nasal cannula with no control group. There was no significant difference in the incidence of tracheal reintubation between high-flow nasal cannula and conventional oxygen therapy (risk ratio RR  0.67, 95 confidence interval CI: 0.24?.90, p  .46). However, there was a lower incidence of tracheal reintubation in patients who were extubated to high-flow nasal cannula versus those extubated to noninvasive ventilation techniques (RR  0.45, 95 CI: 0.32?.63, p  .01). The high-flow nasal cannula group also demonstrated a lower mortality rate compared to the noninvasive ventilation techniques group (RR  0.31, 95 CI: 0.16?.61, p  .01) as well as a shorter postoperative length of stay (mean difference  8.76 days, 95 CI: 13.08 to 4.45, p  .01) and shorter intensive care length of stay (mean difference  4.63 days, 95 CI: 9.16 to 0.11, p  .04). Conclusion High-flow nasal cannula is more effective in reducing the rate of postextubation failure compared to other forms of noninvasive ventilation techniques following surgery for congenital heart disease in pediatric-aged patients. high-flow nasal cannula is also associated with lower mortality rates and shorter length of stay. However, when comparing high-flow nasal cannula to conventional oxygen therapy, the findings were inconclusive primarily due to a limited number of scientific studies available on this specific comparison. Future study is needed to further define the benefit of high-flow nasal cannula compared to conventional oxygen therapy and various types of noninvasive ventilation techniques.",2024,"There was no significant difference in the incidence of tracheal reintubation between high-flow nasal cannula and conventional oxygen therapy (risk ratio RR ?0.67, 95% confidence interval CI: 0.24C1.90, p ?.46).

item_HTXZS8N2,Utility of high-flow nasal oxygen in comparison to conventional oxygen therapy during upper gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures under sedation: A systematic review and meta-analyses.,Puneet Khanna,"BACKGROUND: Sedation and analgesia are the integral components of modern-day upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopic procedures. Irrespective of the sedative agent, hypoxia is the most commonly encountered unwarranted event with sedation. The current study intends to scrutinize whether high-flow nasal oxygen (HFNO) is advantageous for providing respiratory support during upper GI endoscopic procedures over other conventional low-flow oxygen delivery modalities, e.g. nasal cannula, facemask, etc. METHODS: An extensive screening of electronic databases was done till July 31, 2022, after enlisting in International prospective register of systematic reviews (PROSPERO) (CRD42021245409). Randomized controlled trials (RCT), comparative cohort studies, case series, cross-sectional studies and case-control studies evaluating the utility of HFNO during upper GI endoscopy under sedation were included in this meta-analysis. RESULTS: We retrieved eight randomized control studies and one longitudinal study with 3294 patients. The application of HFNO during endoscopy led to lesser incidence of desaturation spells (odds ratio OR  0.23; 95 CI 0.11-0.48; I(2)  71), reduced procedural interruption (OR  0.11; 95 CI 0.02-0.60; I(2)  88), better nadir SpO(2) level during procedure (mean difference MD  3.16; 95 CI 0.54-5.78; I(2)  73), overall lesser incidence of sedation-related adverse events (OR  0.63; 95 CI 0.42-0.93; I(2)  25), with no significant impact on the duration of endoscopy (MD  0.15; 95 CI - 0.02 to 0.31, I(2)  0). CONCLUSION: HFNO is a novel option for upper GI endoscopy under sedation.
